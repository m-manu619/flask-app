Flask App CI/CD Pipeline on AWS using CodePipeline, ECS, and Docker 

This project sets up a CI/CD pipeline for a Flask web application using AWS CodePipeline, Amazon ECS, Amazon ECR, and Docker. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the Flask app to ECS whenever there is a code change in the GitHub repository.

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:

AWS Account with appropriate permissions
GitHub repository containing the Flask app code
Docker installed and configured
AWS CLI installed and configured
AWS CodeBuild setup
Amazon ECS cluster and service
Amazon ECR repository
Required IAM roles for CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and ECS
Project Setup
Create ECR Repository

Go to the Amazon ECR Console.
Create a repository (e.g., flask-app-repo) to store Docker images.
Create Docker Image for Flask App

Create a Dockerfile for the Flask app. Example:
sql
Copy code
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["flask", "run"]
Build and test the Docker image locally:
arduino
Copy code
docker build -t flask-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app
Push the image to the ECR repository:
css
Copy code
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
docker tag flask-app:latest <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/flask-app-repo:latest
docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/flask-app-repo:latest
Set Up AWS CodePipeline

Source: Configure CodePipeline to fetch code from the GitHub repository.
Build: Use CodeBuild to create and push Docker images to ECR.
Deploy: Deploy the Docker image to ECS.
Create ECS Cluster and Service

Create an ECS Cluster.
Set up an ECS Service to use the Docker image from the ECR repository.
Set Up CloudWatch Alarms and SNS Notifications

Create an SNS topic for notifications (e.g., deployment updates).
Set up CloudWatch alarms for monitoring (e.g., high CPU usage).
Configure ECS tasks to send logs to CloudWatch.
Optional: Set Up Application Load Balancer

Create an ALB to provide external access to your ECS service.
IAM Role Setup

Ensure that IAM roles have necessary permissions for:
CodeBuild (permissions for ECR, ECS, CloudWatch, etc.)
CodePipeline (permissions to interact with all required services).
Test the Pipeline

Push a change to the GitHub repository.
Observe the pipeline execution (Source -> Build -> Deploy).
Verify the Flask app is deployed correctly on ECS.
Access the Flask App

If using an ALB, access the app via the ALB URL.
Troubleshooting
ECS container issues: Check ECS task definitions and configurations.
IAM permission errors: Ensure all roles have correct permissions.
Pipeline errors: Check logs in CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and ECS.
Conclusion
This project provides a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Flask application to AWS. It integrates GitHub, Docker, ECS, ECR, CodePipeline, and CloudWatch, streamlining the deployment process and enhancing operational efficiency.
